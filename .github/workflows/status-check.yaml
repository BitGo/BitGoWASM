# This is a thin wrapper workflow that reflects the status of the "Build and Test" workflow.
# It exists solely to provide a clean "test / Test" status check name in GitHub PR status checks,
# avoiding the multi-level name composition that occurs with reusable workflows.
# Configure branch protection rules to require "test / Test" as the status check.
