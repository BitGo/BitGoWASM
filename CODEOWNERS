# BitGoJS code owners and first officers will automatically be requested for review whenever a pull request touches the files they own.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.

# These owners and first officers will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
